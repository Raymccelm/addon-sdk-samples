# ServiceM8 Addon SDK
ServiceM8 is a platform for small business which provides job management functionality. Users are able to signup with no monthly or per user fees and pay only for what they use. 

As each small business is different, each customer can extend their account with addons to suit their industry, country and business requirements. Unlike products where addons are exclusively external products, addons in ServiceM8 can be internal and provide additional functionality on-top of the ServiceM8 platform and enhance the UX of the web and mobile app - Users cannot tell where the platform ends and the addon begins. And because they donâ€™t need to be a separate app, they can be micro-sized to solve specific use cases. 

Find out more on the [ServiceM8 Developer portal](http://developer.servicem8.com/) or signup to [ServiceM8](https://www.servicem8.com).
