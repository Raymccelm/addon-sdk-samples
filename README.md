# ServiceM8 Addon SDK
ServiceM8 is a platform for small business which provides job management functionality. Users are able to signup with no monthly or per user fees and pay only for what they use. 

As each small business is different, each customer can extend their account with addons to suit their industry, country and business requirements. Unlike products where addons are exclusively external products, addons in ServiceM8 can be internal and provide additional functionality on-top of the ServiceM8 platform and enhance the UX of the web and mobile app - Users cannot tell where the platform ends and the addon begins. And because they donâ€™t need to be a separate app, they can be micro-sized to solve specific use cases. 

Find out more on the [ServiceM8 Developer portal](http://developer.servicem8.com/) or signup to [ServiceM8](https://www.servicem8.com).

# Addon SDK Samples
Each folder contains an addon sdk sample project. You can load these into your ServiceM8 developer account and try them out, or use them as a starting point to your own add-on.

## hello-world-addon ##
A simple addon to demonstrate the basics of the addon manifest.json file and connecting to a lambda function. This addon will add a new job action 'Hello Action' to the job card, which will open a popup window and render your lambda function result.

We hope you'll find those sample addons useful and encourage you to re-use some of this code in your own Addon. If you have any questions please email support@servicem8.com. Please submit bug reports to ServiceM8.
